# Iris theme for OmniFocus

Needed to create a theme for OmniFocus that would be easy to the eyes and easy to focus on.
Everything is in the gray and there is no absolute black or white.

Will try to keep it updated along with the future enhancement OmniGroup will add on the theme capabilities.

Don't hesitate to give me your suggestions. I am mainly having fun playing with this but I'm not in any way a  designer.

### Feature
* Evertything is grayed except for active task
* Due task is highlighted so I have no excuse for missing them.
* Soon due are blue
* Left sidebar is darker to keep focus on the task even when it's displayed.

### Todo
* Font! When I will get the time, I will put some love into the fonts... there is alot of bold where it shouldn't.
* Inspector. For now, it's the customization possibility of the inspector is really limited but will update it as soon as possible.
* The status bar at the bottom of the left sidebar need some love with the border and the icon color.
* Highlight color of the forecast icon in the left sidebar need some love.
